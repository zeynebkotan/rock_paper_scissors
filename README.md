A game that we all know. 

But still:

This project is made with love 💚 (also maybe JUST MAYBE little bit of existential crisis 🫠) and at the request of Aygaz Python Bootcamp by Global AI Hub 🟦.

 ## 🎯 What were the goals?
- A message explaining the game rules should be displayed.
- The game rounds can end with three outcomes: the player can win, the computer can win, or a draw.
- A list consisting of rock, paper, and scissors should be defined.
- Counters should be created for the number of rounds and games played, and for player and computer wins.
- The round counter and the counter counting the players' round wins should be reset for each new game.
- The game should continue until either the player or the computer wins 2 rounds. The game should end when someone wins 2 rounds.
- If the player types anything other than "rock/paper/scissors", this answer should be considered invalid and the question should be repeated to the player so that he/she can enter a valid answer.
- The result of each round should be displayed on the screen.
- The player who wins 2 rounds is the winner of the game and his/her name should be printed on the screen when the game is over.
- At the end of each game, both the player and the computer should be asked if they want to continue with a new game.
- If both the player and the computer want to continue the game, the first round of the next game is displayed on the screen.

  Just let you to know, I fulfilled all of them. 💯 (three times, actually.)

## 💪🏻 Things I did to improve the game that were not mentioned in the goals
- I offer not just one language option, but three: English, German and Turkish.
- By allowing the player to choose both their own name and the name of their computer, I make the game even more enjoyable.
- I created a scoreboard with a table view that is displayed after each game with the << display_scoreboard >> function. This way the player can see how many games she/he has played and how many of them she/he has won.
